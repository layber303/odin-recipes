    <p>I mean... who doesn't love pizza?
    </p>
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>½ (12 ounce) can CONTADINA® Tomato Paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano, crushed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil, crushedr</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>

    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>For sauce: Combine all sauce ingredients with 1/2 cup water in a medium
             bowl; set aside for flavors to develop while making crust. Freeze 
             remaining paste .</li>
        <li>Knead for about 4 minutes, on a floured surface, until dough is smooth
             and elastic. Add more flour, if needed. (If using RapidRise® Yeast, let
              dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.)</li>
        <li>Divide dough in half. Pat each half (with floured hands) into a 12-inch 
            greased pizza pan OR roll dough to fit pans.</li>
        <li>Bake for 18 to 20 minutes until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly. 
            For best results, rotate pizza pans between top and bottom oven racks 
            halfway through baking.</li>
    </ol>
